Top Of The World-Carpenters 

Such a feeling's coming over me 
There is wonder in most everything I see 
Not a cloud in the sky  
Got the sun in my eyes 
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream 
Everything I want the world to be 
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear 
It's because you are here  
You're the nearest thing 
To heaven that I've seen 
I'm on the top of the world lookin'  
Down on creation and  
The only explanation I can find 
Is the love that I've found 
Ever since you've been around 
Your loves put me at the top of the world
